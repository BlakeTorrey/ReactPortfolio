            Hi! I'm Blake
        </h2>
        <p>
            I'm a developer based in Salt lake City, Utah. I was originally born in Seattle, WA 
            but moved to SLC when I attended the University of Utah. I was fortunate enough
            to earn a B.S. in Chemistry and another in Biology as I figured out what I liked.
            I job hopped around for a little bit between biology and chemistry opportunities 
            which ultimately grew a desire to learn more about the systems we used. I only got
            more and more interested in computer science as time went on before I decided to 
            learn for myself, and that's how I ended up here. Take a look at the portfolio section 
            if you want to take a look at some of the things I've worked on.       </p>
